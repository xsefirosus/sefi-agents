All notable changes to sefi-agents are documented here. Format follows Keep a
Changelog; this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-11

The software-company release: the roster becomes a 13-agent engineering org, five new
craft/gate skills land (including the cross-cutting anti-hallucination rule), and the
README is rewritten for the public launch.

### Added

- Agents (6 new): engineering-manager, devops-engineer, security-engineer,
  technical-writer, support-engineer, ui-ux-designer.
- Skills (5 new): anti-hallucination (the canonical no-invention rule every agent and
  skill points to), security-review (+ references/security-checklist.md),
  frontend-design (+ references/anti-slop-checklist.md), backend-design
  (+ references/api-checklist.md), technical-writing.
- Full-stack protocol in the software-engineer: vertical slices, contract-first at the
  API seam, backend-design below the seam, frontend-design above it.
- CI checks: validate-agents.sh and validate-skills.sh now require the
  anti-hallucination pointer line in every agent and skill.
- Repository CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) running the full validator suite on
  every push and pull request.

### Changed

- Roster renamed to software-company roles: researcher -> research-analyst, planner ->
  product-manager, implementer -> software-engineer, evaluator -> qa-engineer,
  librarian -> knowledge-manager, automation-architect -> solutions-architect
  (quant-analyst unchanged). All cross-references updated (routing table, roster,
  loops, docs, templates).
- validate-token-budget.sh: the agents/ word cap now scales with roster size
  (agent_count x 640) instead of the fixed 4,500.
- README rewritten as the public-launch page: evidence-first pitch, generic comparison
  with explicit edges, 13-agent / 12-skill tour, FAQ, and a no-invented-numbers
  commitment.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-11

Initial release: loop-engineered multi-agent plugin for Claude Code (also runs
on Hermes Agent, OpenCode, and Codex).

### Added

- `sefi-core` plugin: marketplace + plugin manifests.
- Agent roster (7): researcher, planner, implementer, evaluator, librarian,
  automation-architect, quant-analyst.
- Skills (7): sefi-orchestration, memory-protocol, loop-engineering,
  retro-improve, terse-mode, n8n-workflow-design, strategy-gate.
- Commands (5): init, triage, retro, status, loop-new.
- SessionStart hook that injects the memory router.
- Shell scripts: gate, compress-output, inject-memory, budget-check,
  gen-router, plus eight validators and their run-all entry point under `scripts/ci/`.
- Project templates copied by `/sefi:init`: memory vault, state ledger,
  inbox, two loop specs, config (sefi + budget), GitHub Actions workflow.
- Adapters for Hermes Agent, OpenCode, and Codex.
- Docs: LOOPS, ANTIPATTERNS, CHECKLIST, BUDGET, OPTIONAL-TOOLS.
- `install.sh` (human fallback) and `Install.md` (agent-targeted bootstrap).
